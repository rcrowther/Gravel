== Highlighting
Impossible to plugin. Will look again

/usr/share/highlight/themes/edit-matlab.theme

/etc/highlight

=== XED
Looks like difficult to do. No Documentation
Plugins: Bracket complete/textsize written in Python. All else in C
Highlight: seems to be a GtkSourceLanguage
This it?:
ls /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/ada/lang
It's an XML file. Doable?
sudo cp /home/rob/Code/Gravel/Silt/images/rubble.lang /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-spec
Try here?
~/.local/share/gtksourceview-4/language-specs/
# More to go wrong....
mkdir ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/
cp /home/rob/Code/Gravel/Silt/images/rubble.lang ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/

Total restart of xed required.


=== Geany
Can do by config. That would be Geany spacific, but fast enough
Uses scintilla object

== File icons
Ok, see script
