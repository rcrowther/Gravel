https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Unicode-Manipulation.html
Or Ada

=== Internal dispute
# alignmant
# freeing (or auto-freeing) mallocs

Not beginBlock, its startBlock
Need to be able to inherit from 'all loop blocks' to 'whileLoops' etc.

# String handling
# Hash maps

Full rename to Rubble
Split repositories?

=== IO
Move GIO into Gravel

=== Lexer
Lex exponential numbers
