-reflect
--names
Is used mainly to separate Term names from Type names. It also functions as a slighly boosted string class---it can search down dotted fdpath names. It's also a custom hashtable respresentation, stashed in one array, which is all probably for effieincy, but makes it look a lot more complex than it is.

Names contains the NameTransformer, which is difficult to find. It's here,

library/scala/reflect/NameTransformer.scala:

which mainly ddoes stuff like

  enterOp('>', "$greater")

Why is this done? because they are not valid Java identifiers?
