Though with no current end target of usage, I'm suggesting a set
of categories for classifying phase actions.

++
~ Disambiguates
: Split non-equivalent but same-written expressions e.g. +=(x:String) +=(x:Int)

~ Normalizations
: Unify equivalent but differently-written expressions e.g in expressions, i+j+k and (i+j)+k, or reduction of types.

~ Checks
: Test consistency of structures e.g. stated kinds are consistent.

~ Analysis
: Derive new material from structures. e.g. printers, docuemtation, statistics.

~ Parsers
: Generate an AST tree from source code.

~ Generaters
: Generate machine code from an AST tree
