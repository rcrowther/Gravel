== Containers
Clutch/struct and array are fundamentals


Why can't structs/clutches iterate?
clutch(4)

And (short, determined) arrays be labelled?
array.needle

== Loops
=== determined
4.times(i){

}

Range(2,16).repeat(i){

}

[container].for(obj) {

}

=== Non-determined
[condition].until {

}

[condition].while {

}
