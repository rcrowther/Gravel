== ELF
Despite a day-long effort, I cannot get the Tiny ELF file to transpose 
into Python without a segfault. So generation of ELF files probably 
needs to be dropped. Must use NASM and subprocess it?


== OPCode Reference
The opcode reference comes from,

http://ref.x86asm.net/

It needs conversion to a data structure. And the op-codes interpreting into something that computer code can write.

x64 register_base is a sort of database effort for registers

I had a go at a write-it-myself ELF file. Can't remember if it works. Which is annoying.
