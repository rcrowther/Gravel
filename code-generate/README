=== NASM frame
A base for NASM compiling. Now we have working ELF generation, not so
important. But still here for reference.


=== x64 register_base
a database effort for registers

=== GUIs
The GTK one oworks and you can see how simple tooltips and completion 
may work. But very limited visuals.

Clutter seemed much more like it, but getting the actor stuff to even 
give a pull-down menu is hard. i.e. documentations and maybe even 
structural problems.

simple opCodebuilder.
